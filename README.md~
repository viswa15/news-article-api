# News Article API

This repository contains a simple API which stores and retrieves news articles and their summaries from a SQLite database.

The API is built using Express.js and uses the Better-SQLite3 library to interact with the database.

The API is split into three endpoints:

- `GET /articles`: Returns all articles in the database

- `GET /articles/:id`: Returns a single article by its ID

- `GET /articles?category=<category>`: Returns all articles with the specified category

This API is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at <https://viswa15.github.io/news-article-api>.
